//1.
// Easy Going
// Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.

for (i = 1; i <=20; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}

//2.
// Get Even
// Write a for loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.

// Hint: Think about the increment expression.

for (i=0; i <=20; i+=2){
    console.log(i)
}
